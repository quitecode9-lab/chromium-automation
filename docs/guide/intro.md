# Introduction

Chromium Automaton is a lightweight, Chromium-only automation library built directly on CDP. It provides a Playwright-style API without a test runner or reporting layer.

## Goals
- Small API surface
- Deterministic Chromium download and cache
- Direct CDP usage for speed and transparency

## Non-goals
- Multi-browser support
- Built-in fixtures, reporters, or runners
